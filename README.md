# Gobbler

Bad *incomplete* Go version of [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler). Currently only supports the directory you want to point it at - `-s` is implied. I may convert it into a lib if there is interest/I have the spoons.

Rules have been copied directly from the [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) repo; if the rules are updated there and not here, copy them yourself and recompile.

Please visit the [Snaffler](https://github.com/SnaffCon/Snaffler) repo for questions that aren't specific to Go/missing features from this version.
